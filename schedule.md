# Example On-Site Schedule

The week of the on-site is the most important period during the engagement. Outlined below is an example on-site schedule; this should be adapted for the team's timeline and the state's needs!

## Sunday - Travel Day

Generally the team is assembled on-site by *Sunday night*. This may or may not be feasible depending on travel timelines or organizational rules!

## Monday - Navigator Workshop Day

On Monday we typically hold an in-person solutioning workshop with Navigators. This is best held in a city with a large number of Medicaid recipients (and therefore Navigator organizations), which may or may not be the capitol of the state. For more information on the Navigator workshop, see [the facilitation guide](./resources/navigator-facilitation-guide.docx).

### Tuesday - Travel to Capitol and/or State Kickoff

Since the Navigator workshop is typically not held in the capitol, on Tuesday the team usually travels to the capitol (or wherever the state staff are working).
