# Example On-Site Schedule

The week of the on-site is the most important period during the engagement. Outlined below is an example on-site schedule; this should be adapted for the team's timeline and the state's needs!

## Sunday - Travel Day

Generally the team is assembled on-site by *Sunday night*. This may or may not be feasible depending on travel timelines or organizational rules!

## Monday - Navigator Workshop Day

On Monday we typically hold an in-person solutioning workshop with Navigators. This is best held in a city with a large number of Medicaid recipients (and therefore Navigator organizations), which may or may not be the capitol of the state. For more information on the Navigator workshop, see [the facilitation guide](./resources/navigator-facilitation-guide.docx).

## Tuesday - Travel to Capitol and/or State Kickoff

Since the Navigator workshop is typically not held in the capitol, on Tuesday the team usually travels to the capitol (or wherever the state staff are working).

There may be a kickoff meeting with the state today. The goals of this meeting are:
  - Everyone is clear on **who** the civic technology team is and **why** they are here.
  - Everyone from the state, their vendor team, and the civic technology team knows **where** they need to be and **when**.
  - Everyone knows **how** they'll be expected to contribute.

The kickoff meeting is short; 30 minutes or less.

If time permits, there may be additional Navigator meetings on this day.

## Wednesday - State Workshops Day #1

On Wednesday, we have two workshops with the state. These have been loosely organized around [ex parte renewals](./workshops-and-meetings/ex-parte-workshop.md) and [manual renewals](./workshops-and-meetings/manual-renewal-workshop.md), respectively, but do not have to be!
  - These meetings should be 90 minutes each, and should not be back-to-back.
  - These will be focused on _identifying_ areas of opportunity for solutioning. Solutioning may get started here, but keep in mind there will be lots to talk about!
  - Vendors **should be present** at these meetings.
  - If helpful, eligibility workers may be present at these meetings.
  - After meeting, the civic technology team should meet with state stakeholders for a quick (~5-10 minute) debrief.

If time permits, there may be additional Navigator meetings on this day.

## Thursday - State Workshops Day #2

Thursday has an identical structure to Wednesday:
  - There will be two 90-minute workshops with the state; one on [ex parte renewals](./workshops-and-meetings/ex-parte-workshop.md) amd one on [manual renewals](./workshops-and-meetings/manual-renewal-workshop.md).
  - These meetings should be focused on solutioning, estimation, and prioritization. This is a good time to ask questions like: how long will this take? When can it be scheduled?
  - Vendors **should be present** at these meetings.

Thursday is typically too late for any additional Navigator meetings.

## Friday - Closing Day

On Friday, a [one-hour closing session](./workshops-and-meetings/closing.md) is held with the state in order to present findings.
  - The **state Medicaid Director** and Deputy Director (if appropriate) should be at this meeting, if possible.
  - The civic tech team will present findings from the week, including:
      - Identified opportunities
      - Recommended solutions
      - Timelines from vendors
      - Long-term recommendations
  - It's important to recognize the state staff partners in this meeting; they should be credited with the majority (if not all) of the recommendations.

Friday is often a travel day as well, as team members depart the state.
