# Policy implementation challenges

## Description

When presented with a policy, states are saddled with the burden of turning that policy into code. This translation is not always clean, and isn't always updated when the policy itself is updated. As a result, logic can often reflect old, outdated, or misunderstood policies, resulting in people being improperly failed during ex parte.

## What this looks like

The following are signs that the implementation logic may not match policy:
  - Unintelligible error codes
  - Failure reasons that no one can explain
  - Very old/outdated documentation
  - References to old policies
  - Mismatches in estimates compared to live measurements
    - For example, if a change was estimated to impact X people, but only impacted 1% of that, it may be a policy implementation issue

## Potential solutions

Bring policy staff together with vendors and clarify:
  - What does the policy _actually instruct_?
    - Explain it in the plainest language possible and verify with experts.
    - Cite regulation and statute if necessary.
    - Call experts whenever anything is unclear.
  - How is this logic _currently implemented_?
    - Is the implementation correct?
    - Are there people who are being missed by the implementation?
    - Could the implementation be more efficient?
    - Could the implementation be less strict?
