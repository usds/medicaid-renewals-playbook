# Individiual VS Household Determinations

## Description

Medciaid determinations should be made at the _individual_ level, meaning that individuals within the same household may have different determination statuses. Unfortunately, many states determine eligibility at the household level, meaning individuals who may be eligible are "swept up" in the determination of the household as a whole.

## What this looks like

States were required to self-report this issue to CMS; however, there may be additional symptoms of the issue.

Some signs this may be happening:
- Data is only be avaialable at the case or account level.
- A flag on one person in the case blocks (or excludes) an entire case from moving forward. 
- A case uses the lowest income threshold available for MAGI determinations.
- Mixed cases (MAGI and non-MAGI) are excluded from ex parte.
