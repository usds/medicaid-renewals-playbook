# Social Security Number Issues

## Description

States are required to ask for an individual's social security number when they apply for Medicaid, but they are **not** required to supply it. In addition, there are large groups of people who may not have social security numbers on file with the Medicaid agency:
  - Children under the age of 3
    - When a child is born, they do not have a social security number right away. Most new births during the public health emergency were not followed up on in order to obtain an SSN.
  - Immigrants and non-citizens
    - These people may have an ITIN, which is not the same as an SSN.

SSNs are required for income checks. However, many of these people may not need to have an income check performed for the following reasons:
  - Anyone under the age of 14 cannot work, and therefore should not need an income check.
  - If the state has implemented the 100% FPL waiver, they do not need to check income for someone without an SSN.
    - The waiver itself allows for the state to skip the income check if no data was available from data sources. Because all data sources _typically_ require an SSN, the state has nothing to query, and therefore no data from electronic data sources.
  - If the state is verifying income via categorical eligibility (SNAP, for example), they do not need to perform an additional income check

Regardless, many states exclude all members without an SSN from ex parte.

## What this looks like

The following errors may be symptoms of SSN issues:
  - "No SSN"
  - "Missing SSN"
  - "Cannot query income data sources"
  - "SSN required"
  - "SSN requested"

## Potential solutions

Citing CMS waivers or labor laws, reiterate that there are automatic eligibility pathways for members without SSNs. Work with the state to determine a set of people who can be passed to the ex parte process, despite having a missing SSN. Work with the vendor team to ensure a missing SSN _alone_ does not cause a person to be excluded from ex parte at _any_ stage of the process.
