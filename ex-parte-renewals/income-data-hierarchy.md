# Income Data Hierarchy

## Description

Generally, states have some sort of loose "hierarchy" indicating what income data sources are used in which cases. Good income hierarchy rules query as many income data sources as needed to renew an individual or case; poor income hierarchy rules may not query as many income data sources as possible, leaving data on the table.

## What this looks like

Large amounts of people or cases failing ex parte renewal for the following reasons:
  - "No income data available"
  - "Skipping income check"
  - "Not querying X for data"

## Potential solutions

Describe to the state how best-in-class income verification systems query _all income data sources available_. Question and challenge any logic that excludes certain types of people from certain types of income checks. Once policy aligned, determine an implementation path forward.
