# Closing Meeting

**When**: The last day of the on-site week.

**Who**: The civic technology team, the state staff, and the Medicaid director.

This meeting is where findings are presented to the Medicaid director by both the state staff and the civic technology team. It is _extremely important_ that there are no surprises in this meeting. Everything presented should have already been agreed upon by all parties present. Because this meeting includes senior leadership, it's best to schedule it as early as possible.

If the team has produced a [recommendations document](../../resources/example-recommendations-document.docx), it can be useful to present it at this time.

This meeting is typically one hour.

## Run of Show

Once the room has been assembled, introduce everyone and briefly review the work that's been done so far. Acknowledge the incredible amount of investment from the state staff, and reiterate as many times as possible: these solutions came _from the state staff_.

Then, go through each agreed-upon solution:
  - Briefly describe the opportunity at a high-level
  - Note the number of people impacted (or estimated to be impacted)
  - Breifly describe the recommended solution
  - Allow for additional context from state staff, or feedback from leadership

Once complete, review the plan for work moving forward. How will the team remain involved after this week? What still needs to be done?
