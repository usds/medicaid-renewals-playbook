# Kickoff

**When**: At the very beginning of the state engagement, preferably two weeks before going on-site.

**Who**: The civic technology team and state staff.

The kickoff meeting is used as an introduction for both teams to each other, the work, and the schedule moving forward. This is a good time to talk about high-level goals and begin sketching out the structure of the engagement over the next few weeks.

This meeting typically lasts one hour.

## Mural

[This Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/usdigitalservice0135/m/usdigitalservice0135/1696963326486/fda4345807bd8dd557bd3d71d0780a8768cf4fe1?sender=u7eb3eb6b160ea46bce751540) is an example that can be adapted for state kickoff meetings.

## Run of Show

### Prior to the Meeting

- Ask members of the team and state staff to fill out their information under "Team Introductions".
- Designate a note-taker

### Project Overview - 5 minutes

With everyone in the room (virtually or otherwise), quickly go over why this work is occurring. Introduce the civic technology team, and touch on the goals and sub-goals of the project. Now is a great time for state leaders to voice their support for the work and commit to investing their time.

### Team Introductions - 10 minutes

Go around the room and have everyone give:
  - Their name
  - Their role or title
  - Their organization

Even if someone did not fill out a card in the Mural, they should still be given a moment to introduce themselves to the group.

### Defining Success - 20 minutes

This is a "hopes and fears" exercise. Starting with "hopes":
  - Have participants write down what "success" looks like for this project (i.e. "increase ex parte rates by X%")
  - Each definition of success should have a single sticky note.
  - After a good number of stickies have been written, have participants group them into categories (i.e. "ex parte improvements" or "call center").
  - Once grouped, have participants read groups aloud.

Repeat the exercise with the "fears" column.

### How We'll Get There - 20 minutes

Using hypotheses generated in the [hypothesis generation workshop](./hypothesis-generation-workshop.md), begin determining where the team should spend the majority of their time. Ask questions like:
  - Is this a high priority for the state?
  - Do we feel like this is a feasible area for us to change?
  - Does this align with our top-level goals and North stars?

As opportunities are prioritized, designate key stakeholders and subject matter experts. Capture next steps for the coming week.

(This is often where we run out of time, but this is just the beginning of this conversation!)
