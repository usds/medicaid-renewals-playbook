## Mural

[This Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/usdigitalservice0135/m/usdigitalservice0135/1697052362571/66767314b193563c9b9af6445333205e317489cc?sender=u46dc9256beb1576a38081536) is an example that can be used for leading manual renewal workshops.

## Manual Renewal Workshop #1

**When**: Usually Wednesday of the on-site.

**Who**: The civic technology team, state staff, and vendors (if applicable).

This workshop typically lasts 90 minutes, and is focused on getting policy and prioritization alignment on manual renewal opportunities.

### Run of Show

#### Prior to the Workshop

Populate the Mural with opportunities identified during research and conversations with Navigators. Add as many quotes, screenshots, and artifacts as possible. It can often be the case that state staff have not had the opportunity to witness the renewal process from an enrollee or Navigator perspective; this is their opportunity!

For each opportunity, document to the fullest extent possible:
  - Evidence of the opportunity
  - Estimations of impact
  - Recommendation solutions
  - Known challenges
  - Open tasks

#### Workshop

For each opportunity identified:
  - Go over the opportunity with the group.
  - Ask the state if what is documented accurately reflects their perspective.
    - Are there things missing here?
    - Do the solutions present address the issue?
    - Are there challenges with implementing these solutions?
    - What do we still need to know?

If there are action items or data pulls that need to be performed, capture them and assign owners.

## Manual Renewals Workshop #2

**When**: Usually Thursday of the on-site.

**Who**: The civic technology team, state staff, and vendors (if applicable).

This workshop typically lasts 90 minutes, and is focused on determining ownership and implementation plans for agreed-upon solutions.

### Run of Show

#### Prior to the Workshop

Populate the Mural with any additional information gained after the first workshop. Solutions should start getting detailed at this stage, to the point where action items are beginning to emerge.

#### Workshop

For each opportunity identified:
  - Confirm with the state: is this an opportunity we feel comfortable engaging?
  - Discuss implementation:
    - Determine a set of action items that must be accomplished in order to achieve this effort.
    - For each action item, who is the owner? Who needs to be involved to accomplish it?
    - What is the timeline for each solution?
    - Are there open questions we still have around this opportunity?
