# Paper Notices

## Description

Notices sent by the state to recipients are subject to a large number of requirements in terms of content that must be included and formats it must be presented in. As a result, notices often have confusing or irrelevant information on them through no fault of the state's. These notices can do more harm than good, as confused recipients may take the wrong action based on them.

Translations of notices can also be a common issue. Notices may be translated literally, leading to nonsensical sentences or instructions. They may use antiquated or uncommon dialects, which do not reflect the language being commonly spoken. There also may be a disconnect between the languages someone can speak, and the languages someone can read; if a Marshallese speaker cannot read their Marshallese notice, and brings it into a Navigator, the Navigator may not be able to read it either. 

The timing of notices is also very important. Given mail delivery timelines can be inconsistent, multiple notices may come out-of-order.

## What this looks like

Navigators will often be the best source of data on confusing notices. If enrollees are coming to navigators with any of the following situations, there may be a notice issue:
  - Does not know when their renewal date is
  - Did not open or read their notice
  - Cannot read their notice due to a language issue
  - Cannot understand their notice because it is too complex
  - Doesn't understand what the notice is saying or what action is needed
  - Received conflicting notices

## Potential solutions

Plain text language updates can make a large difference in helping people understand their renewal notice. Relevant information should be at the beginning of the notice, and any actions required should be clearly stated. Legal or irrelevant information should be move to the following pages.

Translations of the notices should be accompanied with English copies, if possible. Navigator organizations specializing in particular languages can be leveraged in proofreading and giving feedback on translations.

Notices should ideally be consolidated into one single notice that can be sent out at one time. This prevents conflicting notices from arriving out of order.
