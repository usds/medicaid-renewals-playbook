# Renewal Forms

## Description

Renewal forms are often more complex and burdensome than is required for a renewal to take place. Forms can often include overly technical language or confusing terminology that make them hard to fill out unassisted. Because renewal forms are traditionally very difficult to change, improvements generally happen very slowly, over the course of years.

## What this looks like

Navigators and enrollees will often have feedback on the renewal form itself. The following may indicate issues:
  - Indications the form is too long
  - Confusion over terms like "biweekly" or "semi-monthly"
  - No quick way to fill out the form itself

## Potential solutions

While renewal forms are typically very difficult to change, the state may be open to some additions or modifications. Engage with the state early on this topic to determine if this is a short or long term possibility.

Some states have implemented cover sheets on their renewal packet, where a recipient can check a box indicating their information has not changed, and does not need to fill out the rest of the packet.

Plain language scrubs can significantly ease the burden and confusion of filling out a renewal packet. Adding helper text to explain confusing terminology may make the experience better for recipients.
