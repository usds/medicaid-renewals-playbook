#  Call Center Issues

## Description

Most states have one (or more) phone lines where people can call and ask questions about a renewal. These lines may be geared towards enrollees and/or Navigators, and are often essential for people who cannot travel to a local office, or may have unreliable mail delivery. However, there are common issues that can affect call centers, resulting in a poor user experience.

### IVR Issues

Some common issues with IVR systems:
  - Long pre-recorded introductory message that does not provide relevant information
  - No non-English language support
  - Inconsistent or incorrect language support
    - This could include either not supporting a required language, or "forgetting" a language selection (i.e. a user requests Spanish, but is routed to an English operator)
  - Confusing or long menus

### Call Center Issues

Some issues typically seen with the call center itself:
  - Long wait times
  - Inaccessible hours (9-5 only, for example)
  - Missing or unclear escalation paths
  - Operators who are not sufficiently trained on common issues
  - Unnecessary rules (for example, only being allowed to speak to the head of household)
  - No ability for Navigators to skip the line

## What this looks like

Call center issues are most easily identified by speaking to Navigators and enrollees, who are often quick to detail their experiences. This is not always a convincing argument for the state, however, so it can be helpful to work with the call center vendor to get data on things like:
  - Call wait times
  - Call abandonment rate
  - Issue resolution
  - Language selection

It can be useful to break these statistics down by county or region.

## Potential solutions

When working with IVR systems, it can be useful to map out the current IVR phone tree and identify where it can be simplified. Identify dead ends, or unnecessary steps, and remove them.

Scripts used in an IVR or read by call center operators can usually be altered or rewritten. Obtain copies of the scripts used, and identify areas for improvement. Can more plain language be utilized? Can relevant information be placed earlier in the script?

While call center processes (escalation paths, or back doors) can be more difficult to alter, it can be useful to simply communicate them to Navigators, who encounter them frequently. If there is no escalation path, this can be communicated back to Navigator groups, who may be waiting in an effort to get a supervisor on the line.
