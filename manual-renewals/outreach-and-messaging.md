# Outreach and Messaging

## Description

States send a variety of messages, and most use mail as the primary delivery mechanism. Mail presents some common challenges for every state; most often, renewal mail may not stand out amongst junk mail, or other mail traffic, resulting in it being thrown away unopened. Mail delivery is also difficult for recipients without permanent addresses or stable living conditions, leading to returned or "bounced" mail.

States may utilize other forms of messaging, including email or SMS. These present similar challenges:
  - Emails or texts may be indistinguishable from spam
  - SMS requires a consistent cellular connection and number
  - Email requires a consistent email address

## What this looks like

Mail issues are usually identified anecdotally. If Navigators are reporting that people do not know when they need to renew, or are claiming they never got a renewal packet, that may be an indication of a packet that is not standing out. High rates of returned or "bounced" mail may indicate a lack of updated addresses.

Email or SMS issues are typically harder to diagnose, as there's no indication if the user received and opened the message. However, Navigators and enrollees can be useful sources here as well.

## Potential solutions

For mail outreach, the following may be useful strategies:
  - Redesigning envelopes to make them stand out amongst other mail
  - Working with the National Change of Address (NCOA) database or MCOs to update recipient's addresses
  - Utilizing web-based messaging services like WhatsApp for outreach
