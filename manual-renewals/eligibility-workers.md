# Eligibility Worker Processes

## Description

Eligibility workers are the experts on almost every part of the Medicaid process. Their workflows are often deeply complex, and take years of training to build expertise. As such, they are often seen as an indispensable resource to the state. This can lead to processes that could be automated being incorporated into eligibility worker's day-to-day tasks. While this is a quick way to implement a process, this leads to increased burden on the workers themselves, who are already working through historic backlogs.

## What this looks like

Processes that are described in the following ways may be implemented as eligibility worker tasks:
  - "Manual processes"
  - "Paper processes"
  - "Temporary workarounds"
  - "Paused eligibility"
  - "Research and outreach"

This is often the case for waivers, which usually are a special scenario that an eligibility worker can easily identify.

## Potential solutions

When a process is implemented an eligibility worker task, determine if it is a candidate for automation. Is this task cleanly defined, affecting an easily-identifiable portion of the population (example: <100% FPL)? Are the outcomes clearly defined (example: renew the person)? What is the current additional burden being shouldered by eligibility workers? How much money (and time) would it save if this were automated?

## Pitfalls

Be aware of possible friction between eligibility workers and thier management. Talk of reducing workload can easily be mis-interepreted as an excuse to reduce staff. These organizations are currently almost universally completely underwater: phrase things in that context. There's already too much work to do with the existing staff, backlogs are growing, etc.
