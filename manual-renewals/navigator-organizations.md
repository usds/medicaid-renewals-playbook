# Navigator Organizations

## Description

Navigators are a crucial part of every Medicaid department. These organizations, however, are not always utilized efficiently or effectively from a state perspective. Some potential issues with Navigator organizations might be:
  - Navigators are completely ignored; the state does not interact or cultivate relationships with them
  - Navigators _are the renewal process_; the state assumes everyone has a Navigator
  - Navigators are given little information on the renewal process, or are not notified when things change
  - Navigators are "assigned" tasks by the state that do not make sense for them to do

## What this looks like

In most states, there is _some_ interaction between Navigators and the state. Dig in on this relationship:
  - When does the state reach out to Navigators?
  - What information does the state provide?
  - What are the key problems Navigators see with this relationship?
  - What do Navigators wish they had?

## Potential solutions

A key step to improving the Navigator-state relationship is to bring state staff members into the room when doing Navigator research. In interviews with Navigators, either invite state staff to participate in person, or virtually. During [the Navigator workshop](../workshops-and-meetings.md), have the state staff present and actively participate.
