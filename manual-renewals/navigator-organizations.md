# Navigator Organizations

## Description

[Navigators](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/navigator/), sometimes also called assistors or community partners, are a crucial part of the Medicaid ecosystem. They serve as a critical link between the state and Medicaid participants, especially the most vulnerable, such as those experiencing homelessness, and people who have a language or literacy barrier. Navigators are subject matter experts on the needs of their communities, and as front line workers they know which parts of the renewal process are most challenging or confusing.

While some states have great relationships with their navigator orgs, other states have no connection to them at all. Even when a relationship does exist, states don't always effectively leverage the expertise of navigators. 

Additionally, these organizations often face barriers themselves which can prevent them from effectively supporting their clients. Navigators generally have access to an online portal that allows them to see clients' applications, renewals, and account details. However, these portals often have challenges ranging from simple UX issues to missing critical functionality such as not being able to transfer clients between navigator orgs.


## What this looks like
Some potential issues with the state/navigator relationship might be:
  - Navigators are completely ignored; the state does not interact or cultivate relationships with them
  - Navigators _are the renewal process_; the state assumes everyone has a Navigator and under-invests in the self-service user experience as a result
  - Navigators are given little information on the renewal process, or are not notified when things change
  - The relationship is one-sided, where the state gives guidance to navigators but navigators do not have a path to provide feedback to the state

In most states, there is _some_ interaction between Navigators and the state. Dig in on this relationship:
  - Does the state have contacts at these orgs that they can introduce you to for user research?
  -   If not, that is a red flag that there likely is not a close relationship
  - When does the state reach out to Navigators?
  - What information does the state provide?
  - What are the key problems Navigators see with this relationship?
  - What do Navigators wish they had?
  - Do navigators have a contact at the state that they can reach out to when they need to escalate a problem or difficult case?

## Potential solutions

A key step to improving the Navigator-state relationship is to bring state staff members into the room when doing research with navigators. In interviews with Navigators, either invite state staff to participate in person, or virtually. During [the Navigator workshop](../logistics/navigator-workshop.md), have the state staff present and actively participate.
