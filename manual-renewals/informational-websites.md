# Informational Websites

## Description

As a state's Medicaid program evolves, they typically accumulate a number of different domains and websites instructing recipients on how to apply (or renew) their Medicaid. These multiple websites are often a result of competing rules on what can be updated or displayed in which spots, or may be the result of different teams working on different sites. Having multiple informational sites can cause a couple different issues:
  - If the sites have consistent content, they may be subject to SEO issues, as duplicate sites result in flags of plagiarism
  - If the sites have inconsistent content, they may result in users taking the wrong action

## What this looks like

The existence of multiple informational websites is often most apparent to the enrollees themselves. Speaking with enrollees or Navigators often reveals any competing information sites. It can also be useful just to Google "how to renew Medicaid in (STATE)", and see what comes up!

## Potential solutions

Ideally, users would have one source of truth for renewal information, eliminating the danger of sites being forgotten or drifting out of date. If possible, point all informational domains to one site. If this is not possible, consider using redirects or links to bring users to a single source of truth. Consistent information across all sites should be the last solution, but is still better than conflicting information.
