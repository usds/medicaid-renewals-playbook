# Online Experience

## Description

The online renewal experience may still be fairly new for some states, and can look very different based on the implementation. Some states will endeavor to recreate their entire renewal packet virtually, while others will create a renewal "flow" that guides users to questions as needed. Other may opt for a simple file-upload, where users can upload a scanned form or verification documents.

Some common issues with the online experience may include:
  - File upload size limits, forcing users to break up their upload into multiple files
  - Lack of mobile support
  - Accessibility issues
  - Burdensome or restrictive identity proofing requirements
  - Inability to reset passwords or retrieve usernames

## What this looks like

When an online experience is poor, it may look either like a _lot_ of complains about the website, or _zero_ complaints about the website (because no one uses it). When speaking with enrollees or Navigators, ask: does anyone renew online? Why or why not? What's the experience like?

Ask for any traffic numbers the state may have. How many people renew online? On what platforms? What barriers do they face?

An easy way to identify problems is to make an online account, and see what it looks like! Access it on both desktop and mobile, and see where in the process you get stuck.

## Potential solutions

Using traffic numbers, ensure the state knows how many people are experiencing any issues with the online platform. Make these problems visible through screenshots, quotes, or demos.
