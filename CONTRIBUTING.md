# USDS Medicaid Renewals Playbook - Contribution

Thank you for contributing the this playbook! It's our goal to keep this playbook **open, collaborative, and evolving**. The strategies documented here didn't start with us; we just happened to be the ones who wrote them down. They won't end with us either! We welcome all contributions from everyone involved in any stage of this process.
