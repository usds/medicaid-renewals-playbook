# Prioritization Session

**Who**: The civic tech vendor and the state staff.

**When**: Following the week of the on-site.

Generally, an on-site engagement produces more recommendations than is feasible to take on in a short time. A prioritization session provides the framework for the state to determine which opportunities to move forward with.

[This Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/usdigitalservice0135/m/usdigitalservice0135/1697052416791/87dc6c254c8284a073a5a098fb5fc31942be888f?sender=u46dc9256beb1576a38081536) provides an example space for this session to take place.

## Run of Show

### Prior to the Meeting

Populate the Mural with the recommendations [presented during the closing session](./closing.md).

### During the Meeting

Step through the recommendations each in turn. For each, discuss:
  - What's the level of impact here? How many people will potentially be renewed based on this recommendation? How many people could potentially have an improved renewal experience due to this change?
  - How difficult will this change be to implement? How long will it be before it is live and impacting people?

Based on the discussion, place the recommendation on the graph. Once all are placed, talk through the "high-priority" items (high impact, low difficulty). What are the next steps for these items? Talk through the "low-priority" items (low impact, low difficulty). Are we okay with delaying these items until later?
