</div>

## Background

This playbook was created by the U.S. Digital Service as a rapid-response guide for civic technologists providing direct technical assistance to states during Public Health Emergency (PHE) Unwinding. The content in this playbook focuses on strategies to decrease the burden of Medicaid renewals on members of the public and state staff.

## Plays

### 1 // Establish Trust and Urgency

It is crucial to establish a relationship of trust with state partners from the beginning of an engagement. Every stage of the process is predicated on an exchange of details and data. This exchange may not be comfortable with state partners, as it may (and hopefully will) expose issues in their implementation and processes. Establishing trust is the single most important tool for counteracting this discomfort.
In addition, it’s important that all members of the team (including any and all vendors) understand the urgency and criticality of the project. Leadership should be engaged regularly from the beginning, and the work should be made a top priority. Common goals should be established such that everyone understands what “success” looks like.

* **Keep states’ needs top of mind.** States are under an immense amount of pressure right now. Be mindful of the amount of work state staff have on their plates, celebrate the great work they’re already doing, and focus the scope of work around the most urgent state needs.
* **Orient the team around OUTCOMES, not compliance.** Quickly establish norms around what will (and won’t) be reported, and who needs to be consulted beforehand.
* **Get buy-in from senior leadership, including the [State Medicaid Director](https://medicaiddirectors.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Public_DirectorsList_June2023-1.pdf) and Deputy Director.** Establish this work as the top priority for the team.
* **Convene a cross functional group** of subject matter experts and decision makers, including Policy, Communications, Human-Centered Design and Technical experts (including vendor teams)
* **Determine one or two North Star(s).** What goals are we specifically working towards? These should be measurable (“increase automatic renewals to XX%”) but don’t have to be numeric (“stand up an online renewal form”).
* **Adopt terminology from the state.** For example, if they call a renewal a “review”, this should be the term used throughout the work. 
* **Go where the work is.** Travel to where your state partners and their Medicaid members are.
